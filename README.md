1. Put the services.php file and services.csv file in the same folder in your PC
2. Go to cli command terminal and change directory into the folder where the files are
3. Enter "cd /downloads/runservices"  ======> The "downloads" and "runservives" folder are example folders
4. Enter "php services.php" and watch the cli output the results from the csv file
